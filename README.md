## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kassim and I make apps that I have found a need for in my day to day life.

You might have come here through some of my promoted projects:

- [Bottle Radio](https://github.com/MrLemur/bottle-radio) - All in one solution for your own web radio station with auto playback and live streaming
- [Park My Bike](https://github.com/MrLemur/parkmybike) - Find bike parking infrastructure in London while on the go

Here are some stats about the languages I use:
